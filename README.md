# SEED-Lab-Team-6

## Organization of this Repository
- The Mini Project folder contains all of the code used in the mini project
- The demo 1 folder contains all of the code used in the demo 1 project
- The Project Boards located in the Projects tab outlines each of the subsystems and the tasks related to each subsystem
as well as who is responsible for each task. There is a project board for each folder in the root of this repository

## Purpose 
- This repository contains the code used to create motor control systems and an autonomous rover that follows blue tape
- This repository shows which team member was responsible for each subsystem on each deliverable

## Mini Project
1. Determine which quadrant of the raspberry pi's camera a yellow object is located
2. Send the quadrant number to the Arduino 
3. Based on the quadrant number, use the Arduino to control a motor which sets a wheel at the desired angle

## Demo 1
1. Design a rover that is able to rotate a specified angle and drive straight a certain distance 
2. Deisng a computer vision system for the rover that is able to detect blue tape in front of the rover and measure the angle of the blue tape
   from the direction the rover is facing.
