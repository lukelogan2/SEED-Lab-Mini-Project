# SEED-Lab-Mini-Project

## Purpose 
- This repository contains the code used to create a motor control system using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino
- This repository shows which team member was responsible for each subsystem on the project

## Motor Control System 
1. Determine which quadrant of the raspberry pi's camera a yellow object is located
2. Send the quadrant number to the Arduino 
3. Based on the quadrant number, use the Arduino to control a motor which sets a wheel at the desired angle
